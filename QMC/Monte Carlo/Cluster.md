# Wolff-Cluster

AFM??

For
$$
\mathcal{H} = \sum_{\langle ij \rangle} -J_{ij} \sigma_{i} \sigma_{j}.
$$
All we need to do is just change the add probability $P_{\text{add}}$ from $1 - e^{-2\beta J}$ to
$$
P_{\text{add}} = 1 - e^{-2\beta J_{ij}}.
$$

# Geometry Cluster
The proof is similar with Wolff-Cluster algorithm. Consider two configurations $\mu$ and $\nu$, we have
$$
\frac{g_{\mu \rightarrow \nu}}{g_{\nu \rightarrow \mu}} = e^{-\beta(E_{\nu} - E_{\mu})}.
$$
In geometric cluster algorithm, two clusters are formed simultaneously, thus two boundaries
