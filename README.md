Hi! This repository is used to sync my notes via different devices. ðŸ˜ƒ  
The notes in the repository are mainly from 2023 on onwards. Many notes disappeared with my old computer due to one unscrupulous computer repair shop...ðŸ™ƒ  
  
The contents in the repository include:  
`code` This folder contains the notes when I learning DQMC code. This folder has been discontinued for maintenance due to the use of the new version of code.  
`linux` This folder contains many Linux commands to remind me.  
`Many-Body` Some notes about many-body physics and *Quantum Field Theory in Condensed Matter Physics* and *Interacting Electrons and Quantum Magnetism*.  
`Math` Some useful math knowledges.  
`Pic` Used to save the pictures in the note. If it's not exists, the display of the pictures in the note is abnormal.  
`Project` Some results and work log about my project.ðŸ¤«  
`QMC` Some notes about quantum Monte Carlo method.  
`Statistical Physics` Some notes about statistical physics and the book *Statistical Physics of Fields*.  
  
That's all. I'll try my best to maintenance this repository in the future, hoping that it can become a precious treasure when I receive a doctor's degree.ðŸ’ª
